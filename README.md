## Usage

This site will be used by users to help plan their day by the hour. Inputs in the textarea will be saved to localstorage and will be retrieved when the site is visited next. The inputs in the textarea will remain there untill the user clears it manually. As the day progresses, the current hour will be highlighted along with the future hours.

## Credits

I would like to thank the University of Minnesota's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp for providing the source code
